Git is primarily used to manage your project, comprising a set of code/text files that may change.
Git stands for "GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER". 

Git was created in the year 2005 by Linus Torvalds. The same person who created linux. 

In todays world, we are using so many code but there was no centralized repository before. Hence it was important to have centralized 
repository, so that it can be stored and save.

GIT bub gives the platform for coders to have a centralized repository, you can save your code, make it public or private in GIT hub. 

It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. 

Developers can use Git to maintain a history of changes to their code. 

GIT is called Version control system. 
Git is VCS because it helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers.
